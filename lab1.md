   This quick guide that I've step up will hopefully teach you how to set up a remote access account into a course account on ieng6. The steps include: 
      
   1. Installing a Source Code Editor (preferably VS Code).
   2. Establishing a remote connection through your terminal
   3. Exploring the remote connection with some commands
        
        
      
   ## Step One: Installing VS Code

   - Now you can open up the terminal on your VS Code. (command J on mac and command or ctrl + on windows to open up a new terminal).

   ## Step Two: Connect to the CSE 15L Remote Server
   
  Now that our VS Code is set up and running, we could use the terminal to set up a remote connection to a server. But first, we need to found our           CSE15L account in this link:
